# Theory and Practice of Side Channel Attacks: Project 1
This the repository for Project 1 of the NPTEL+ Workshop on <b>Theory and Practice of Side-Channel Attacks</b> taught by Prof. Chester Rebeiro of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras.

### Difference of Means (DOM) Attack
Please refer to the file DOM_attack.txt for the code. Acknowledgements to Aditya, a fellow participant in the course for help in putting this together. The inputs to the Python script are given in the files: textin_array.npy, textout_array.npy and trace_array.npy. textin_array.npy and textout_array.npy are attached here with extensions changed. trace_array.npy is too large to be attached here.

The key that is found as a result of the above attack is [82, 254, 7, 155, 11, 230, 132, 205, 160, 224, 10, 33, 143, 197, 110, 73].
